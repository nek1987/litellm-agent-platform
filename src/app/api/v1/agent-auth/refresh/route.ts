/**
 * POST /api/v1/agent-auth/refresh
 *
 * Exchange a long-lived refresh token (15min default; ~24h in practice for
 * the per-pod tokens) for a fresh access token. Called by the harness's
 * MCP tool handler when it gets a 401 from a memory route — the handler
 * swaps in the new access token and retries the original call once.
 *
 * The refresh token IS the credential — no Authorization header is required
 * (and one would be redundant; the refresh token's HMAC proves provenance).
 * That's also why this is its own route: every other v1 route under
 * /managed_agents/* takes a bearer, so a brand-new pod would have nothing
 * to send before it gets its first access token rotated.
 *
 * The token's `scope` and `agent_id` mirror what the server originally
 * minted at pod-spawn time — we re-derive them from the refresh token's
 * claims rather than letting the caller pick. Refresh is purely a
 * lifetime extension, not a privilege bump.
 *
 * No DB round trip. Verification is HMAC + `exp` check.
 *
 * Errors:
 *   400 — missing/blank refresh_token
 *   401 — bad signature, expired, or wrong-kind token
