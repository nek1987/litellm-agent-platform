# LiteLLM Agent Platform

LiteLLM Agent Platform lets anyone run a harness (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes) as a service. They select a harness, tools, and a system prompt, deploy it, and can start running and managing agents.

You can get agents using Claude Code, Hermes, and OpenCode with session management, planning and execution, feedback, memory, MCP tools, and CRON schedules.

## Make an agent in the UI

The easy way. Non technical people can make agents too. Select a harness, attach your tools, set a system prompt, and deploy.

1. **Select a harness.** Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, or OpenCode.
2. **Set it up.** Attach your tools and a system prompt. Your MCP servers and keys are already there from when you signed in.
3. **Deploy it.** One click. Then start running and managing agents from the UI or an API.

### Your tools are already connected

Add a key to the platform once. When you sign in, your GitHub and AWS MCPs are already there. You do not add them again. The agent just uses the keys.

## Make an agent with the API

Everything you can make in the UI you can make over the API.

### Create an agent

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/agents -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "ci-fixer",
    "harness": "claude-code",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "system_prompt": "You monitor CI and fix failing checks.",
    "tools": ["github", "aws"]
  }'
```

### Run the agent

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/agents/ci-fixer/runs -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_KEY" \
  -d '{ "input": "Fix the failing CI check on PR #418" }'
```
